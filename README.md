# Try Yeoman and Backbone
This is a testing app made to try Yeoman (Yo + Grunt + Bower) by following a little tutorial: [Building HTML5 Apps with Yeoman and Backbone May 11 2013](http://rockyj.in/2013/05/11/yeoman_and_backbone.html).

The original tutorial seems to have a couple of erratas or information that have been avoided:

- You have to install `generator-mocha` when installing `generator-backbone` and before running `yo` to scaffold the app.
> What is Mocha? [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on node and the browser with asynchronous support.

- Before running `grunt server` command for first time, be sure that you have an updated version of sass gem. To update it I did `gem install sass`.

Finally, I would like to thanks to [Ricky Jaiswal](http://rockyj.in/) for his tutorial.
